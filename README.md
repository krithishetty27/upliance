# Upliance

The objective of this assignment is to analyze datasets related to user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends. 

You will work with three datasets: UserDetails, CookingSessions, and OrderDetails. 

The task involves cleaning and merging the data, analyzing the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders, identifying popular dishes, and exploring demographic factors that influence user behavior. 

Additionally, you will create visualizations to showcase key insights and write a report summarizing your findings and business recommendations. 
# Popular Dishes

1. Optimized Cooking Programs: 

Prioritize Development: Upliance should prioritize developing optimized cooking programs for Spaghetti and Grilled Chicken, ensuring consistent and delicious results for these popular dishes.

Refine Programs: Focus on refining the cooking programs for Pancakes, Veggie Burger, and Oatmeal to improve their taste and presentation. This could involve adjusting cooking times, temperatures, and stirring patterns.

2. User Interface and Guidance:

Highlight Popular Dishes: The Upliance machine's user interface should prominently feature Spaghetti and Grilled Chicken, possibly with attractive images and brief descriptions.

Recipe Suggestions: The machine could proactively suggest Spaghetti or Grilled Chicken as recipe recommendations based on user preferences or past cooking history.

Personalized Guides: For less popular dishes, the machine could provide more detailed step-by-step guides or video tutorials to encourage users to try them.

1. Positive Correlations:

Total Orders vs. Duration (mins): A moderate positive correlation suggests that users who spend more time in cooking sessions tend to place more orders. This could indicate that longer sessions lead to greater engagement and a higher likelihood of ordering.

Session Rating vs. Amount (USD): A strong positive correlation implies that users who give higher ratings to their cooking sessions also tend to spend more money on orders. This could suggest that positive experiences in the app translate to higher spending.

2. Negative Correlations:

Age vs. Total Orders: A weak negative correlation suggests a slight tendency for younger users to place more orders. However, this relationship is not very strong.

Age vs. Duration (mins): A weak negative correlation suggests that younger users might spend slightly less time in cooking sessions compared to older users. Again, this relationship is not very strong.

3. Interpreting the Results:

By analyzing this heatmap, we can gain valuable insights into user behavior:

Engagement and Spending: Users who spend more time in cooking sessions and give higher ratings to their experiences are more likely to spend more money on orders. This suggests that engagement and satisfaction are crucial factors in driving revenue.

Age and Behavior: While there are weak negative correlations between age and some other variables, the overall impact of age on user behavior seems to be limited.

# Meal Preferences

1. Insights:

Dinner is the most preferred meal among users, accounting for a significant 50% of the total preferences. Lunch comes in second with 30% of user preferences and Breakfast has the lowest preference among users, with only 20%.
